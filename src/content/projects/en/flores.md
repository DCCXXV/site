> A simple terminal screensaver that prints flowers growing. Inspired by cbonsai and cmatrix.

## Why

I like flowers and terminals ^^

## Features

- Many flags allowing:
    - Changing speed of "simulation"
    - Selecting a seed for deterministic output
    - Enabling true color instead of using the terminal's theme
    - Choosing which flower types to print
    - ... and more!
- Cute ASCII art

<div class="img-file">flores.png</div>
<div class="img-frame">
    <img src="/images/projects/flores.png" alt="The screensaver running (flores -f rose,daisy,sunflower,lavander)" />
    The screensaver running (flores -f rose,daisy,sunflower,lavander)
</div>
